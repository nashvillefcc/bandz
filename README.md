# Bandz
A band website for the fictional group "Jessica and the Pips". 

This project was created by Nashville Free Code Camp (@nashvillefcc) using html, css and vanilla JavaScript.  
As well as serving as a chance to improve our skills with these technologies, we have also learned and practiced the following:
* Wireframing with Figma
* Project organization using Trello
* Version control using Git
* Collaboration using GitHub
